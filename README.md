# Ethan's Personal Portfolio Website

This project is the first of many projects I aim to display on my GitHub (and later this website). The objective is to create a simple, smooth, and stylized website that will assist me in showcasing how amazing I am (HA HA) and what I have accomplished, along with some personal details about me.

## Personal Information

### About me and this project

Hello! As described above, this is my website. I'm a graduate computer science student with the goal of enhancing this GitHub repository. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to transfer my university work since graduating, and my GitLab account has since been wiped. Therefore, I'm working on several meaningful projects to showcase my skills, worth, and my ability to work on multiple projects using GIT.
